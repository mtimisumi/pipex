After spending two pleasant weeks with Nino in France, Lenù comes back home and insists on getting a divorce. She leaves her children with Pietro’s parents. After two years of relationships with Nino, she discovers that he had lied about leaving his wife. She decides however to continue with him, and to go back to Naples. There, she once again becomes pregnant. Lila becomes pregnant at the same time by Enzo, and they give birth to two daughters only three weeks apart. Lila names her daughter Nunzia (known as Tina), like her mother, and Lenù names her daughter Immacolata (known as Imma), also like her mother, who is dying of cancer.

Lenù discovers through Lila that Nino continues to be unfaithful, having had a series of affairs and even propositioned Lila again. She decides to leave him and goes back to the neighborhood, living close to Lila.
